   Other options
   4.) git pull # push from remote repository to local repository

   Problem that I am seeing is that there is a repository called eb_meetings within a repository called eb_meetings, perhaps figure

Thursday, Jan 16th 

   To do: I want to write out the passing sequences to a text file like so:

      MF996804.1 
      MG548660.1 
      MG548661.1 
      MG807646.1 
      MG807647.1 
      MH158236.1 
      KY553111.1 
      KY272987.1 
      KX377336.1
   
   Meeting with Eric, to do next week: 
   
   Percent identity, rank by average, and then pick off of the full seq list. 

   Percent identity check if it is in the full seq list, and then if yes, propose that model, if in that list, output that line 
   Store in a list or a hash

   hash , keys and values - a more efficent way of checking 

   add output root ZB1.2

   after setting up and pushing from local to remote, you can just use git push 

   cp ../vadr_files/test_python/prune-gaps.py . - to move 

   git push --set-upstream origin main

   Hi Adrien, I hope you are having a new year! I was looking at your website a during the hackathon, 
   and I saw that you went to the MarMic program for your graduate degree. How 
   did you like it? I am applying to master's degrees, and am super interested in the program. 
   I would love to talk to you about it if you have time!

   I also would like to learn more about your cartoons, they are super cute. 

   Letters of recommendation:

   I was wondering if you could write me a letter of recommendation for MarMic program:
   https://marmic.mpg.de/marmic2/mscprogram.php?section=msc#:~:text=MarMic%20offers%20a%20combined%20M,MarMic%20students%20enters%20the%20Ph.

   Here are the criteria for the recommendation:

      Two Letters of Reference. The criteria for assessment are that the letter contains
   statements referring to the applicant’s theoretical knowledge, practical skills,
   creativity, flexibility, commitment, a sense of responsibility and ability to work in a
   team. 

   They also asked to describe working in an international setting. 

   To convert from .stk file to pfam.stk file:

   I tried my script with va-zikv-south-america-ZB.2.0, and good news, my script is working super well! 
   Bad news, there are no full seqs with va-zikv-south-america-ZB.2.0, this is the closest one:

   I am sooo confused about why the american genotype isn't pulling up more full sequences. 
   The same sequences are coming back as full when run as a clade, for example with the caribbean sequences 
   
   might have to do with rf gaps lollll, I might have to write a script that detects rf and removes columns based on rf gaps

   create python script called remove-rf-gaps.py 

   number the lines of the characters 
   -, A, C, T, G, N

   Tomorrow - 
   Could try and script the rf or do the hash map for some, I will see what eric thinks . My name is EB Dickinson and I am trying to code better than before . Mbifes what I can type withou
   t looking at the keyboard wow look at me ahhhhhhh!

   American sequences

   Because of the gap rfs from a sequence () that is bigger than the reference sequence, I have pulled out sequences based on what a "full sequence" is 
   in comparison to NC_035889, the reference sequence. So that means, a gap of 1 at the beginning, and an end of 366.

Questions to ponder: 
            
So, we have a new asian model MG807646.1

For the genotype model, should we test:
Asian: MG807646.1
American: NC_035889 or (KU509998.3)
African: KY...

For the clades:

va-zikv-ZA-african: KY..
va-zikv-ZB.1.0-southeast-asian: KX377336.1 
va-zikv-ZB.1.1_southern_asia: MN611472.1
va-zikv-singapore-ZB.1.2: MG807646.1
va-zikv-south-america-ZB.2.0: KU509998.3
va-zikv-central-america-ZB.2.1: MN577550.1
va-zikv-caribbean-ZB.2.2: MF384325.1

To do: 

() first run three models against the full list of zikv-759 or zikv-762 sequences 
() should we use NC_035889 since we don't know the Genotype? we could potentially use the seabra method to detect the genotype/clade since we are only assuming it is from south america
() figure out how to compare between the original list of sequences and what VADR has detected (percent accuracy)

() then shall we the clades against the full list of asian sequences

Tuesday, Feb 4th 

() talked with Eric today about github push of vadr_files
   () decided to use new models generated from each genotype, need to build new models using adv-v-build 
   () add secondary structure to new 

(d) Talk to Eneida about improvements with NCBI Virus in strain
